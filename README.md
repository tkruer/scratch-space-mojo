# scratch-space-mojo

This is a scratch space for some algorithms in Mojo and their Python counterparts.

I'll continue to update this as I go along. I like the language for the most part. It's pretty new and slightly all over the place but I am going to continue to try it out.

Got a faster example than mine? Let me know!
